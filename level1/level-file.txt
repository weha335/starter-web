Writing code has a place in the human hierarchy worth somewhere above grave robbing and beneath managing. (Gerald Weinberg) Deleted code is debugged code. (Jeff Sickel) First, solve the problem. Then, write the code. (John Johnson) You can either have software quality or you can have pointer arithmetic, but you cannot have both at the same time. (Bertrand Meyer) Computer science education cannot make anybody an expert programmer any more than studying brushes and pigment can make somebody an expert painter. (Eric Raymond)
